# Joplin Command Line Interface (CLI) API for Python
As per the [Joplin homepage](https://joplinapp.org/api/references/rest_api/), you should likely look for a different API. This one is made to communicate with the [Joplin Terminal Application](https://joplinapp.org/terminal/), and it is made by a political scientist for fun and for personal use. That said, should you find it to your liking -- feel free to contribute!
